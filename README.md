# DevHaven
Mulitplayer Game using pokemon api.

Run following commands: 

`npm i express`

`npm i socket`

`nodemon server.js`

Guess the pokemon from shadow and enjoy!!!!

We have also used ngrok to make localhost public so that page can open on all devices using new link

# FUTURE PLANS
- Multiplayer feature extension
- Improving UI by adding pages
- adding login logout page so that users can have their saved progress, etc in profile
- Adding some game modes like the one in pokemon go!.
